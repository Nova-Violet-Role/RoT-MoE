# MUTATION SUITE -- Proofs/RotP24Control.lean (the control that retracted O4)
#
#   1. assert the needle is present EXACTLY once before mutating; else DISCARDED
#   2. assert the mutation LANDED after patching
#   3. delete the stale .olean so Lake cannot skip the rebuild
#   4. rebuild, read the exit code DIRECTLY
#   5. restore from the backup, always
#
# DISCARDED != SURVIVED.
#
# AIMED AT a RETRACTION, which is the one result nobody is tempted to check.
# The claim here is that the O4 sweep was an artefact of evidence volume. If
# that claim can survive a rewritten probe, a weakened confound condition or a
# gutted separation theorem, then the retraction is as unfounded as the verdict
# it withdrew -- and an unfounded retraction is just an excuse with a proof
# next to it.
